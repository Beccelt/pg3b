= Introduction =

The following diagrams show the steps required to assemble a PG3B Prototype II circuit board. The parts are listed in the PG3B Prototype II : Bill Of Materials.

= Details =

There are four parts to the assembly instructions. The first part lists the steps, 1 - 8, required to solder the circuit for XBox 360 analog controls. This part of the circuit is used by PG3B to manipulate Left and Right Thumbsticks, and Left and Right Triggers.

Having followed the soldering plan Part I and Part II, the bottom of the board should look as follows:

Notice that the solder joints are shiny and conical. This is how your solder joints should appear. If any are dull then re-heat the joint, adding a bit of flux and a very small amount of solder.
